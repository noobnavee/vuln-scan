3. **Open Ports Scanning**: Uses nmap to scan for open ports.
4. **WHOIS Information Gathering**: Retrieves WHOIS data for the target domain.
5. **Detailed Report Generation**:
    - **Vulnerability Summary**: Summarizes found vulnerabilities.
    - **Detailed Scan Results**: Provides comprehensive details for each scan component.
    - **Recommendations**: Offers specific recommendations for fixing identified issues.
    - **Colored Output**: Enhances readability with color-coded results.

## Important Notes
